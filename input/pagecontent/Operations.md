## Operations

### Common

Currently the only guideline set is to use HTTP based operations (REST) in the transactions. The results are given as HTTP status codes and a possible bundle of resources. 

### Basic operations

- HL7fiSched_REQ1: Query for free appointments
- HL7fiSched_REQ2: Book an appointment 
- HL7fiSched_REQ3: View previous appointments
- HL7fiSched_REQ4: Cancel an appointment
