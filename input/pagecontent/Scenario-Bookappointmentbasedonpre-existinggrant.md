### Scenario - Book appointment based on pre-existing grant

If your organisation wishes to allow patients to book an appointment for themselves to a special healthcare service, your booking service can enable booking based on a pre-existing reservation grants.

This can be useful when a patient is checked by doctor, but the next appointent is not urgent and they both agree that patient can select a suitable time. This can also reduce the need to cancel or reschedule appointments later.

Reservation grant can be modeled as an Appointment status set to "proposed".
