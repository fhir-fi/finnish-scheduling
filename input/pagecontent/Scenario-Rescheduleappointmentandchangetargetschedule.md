### Scenario - Reschedule appointment and change target schedule

By enabling patients to reschedule appointments, your organisation can redirect the healthcare resources more efficiently or offer the time slot for another patient. Patient-initiated rescheduling can reduce inqueries or reschedule requests to healthcare professionals, and reduce no-shows.

Allowing the booking service to change the target schedule (healthcare professional or a team etc), can also allow more flexibility to resource allocation.
