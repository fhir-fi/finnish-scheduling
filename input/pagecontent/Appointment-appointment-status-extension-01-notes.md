This example starts an example flow of appointment booking from initial identification of the need
and proposal of the time, to patient moving the time of the appointment, and finally the encounter
taking place.

Note that the `id`s of the Appointment resource instances change in this implementation guide. In
real life, the 3 first examples of the flow would share the same id, as would the 7 last ones.

The process continues with example
