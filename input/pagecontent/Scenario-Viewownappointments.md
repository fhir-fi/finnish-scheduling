### Scenario - View own appointments

If a booking service wishes to show patient's own appointments, one can perform an Appointment search. After that, an appointment can be displayed, with information about the performed service, start and end time, preparation instructions etc. Also displaying the appointments enables one to cancel or reschedule them. 

Allowing patients to view their appointments can also decrease communication requests to healthcare professionals, for example inqueries about the start time or location of patient's appointment.
