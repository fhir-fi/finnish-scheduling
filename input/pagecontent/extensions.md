The primary way to adapt the FHIR specification to specific requirements of a jurisdiction is
through [extensions](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extensibility.html).

### Extensions for Finnish Base Profiles

This list includes the extensions for scheduling related profiles defined by HL7 Finland.

### Extensions in other Finnish Implementation Guides

Please also note the
[extensions listed in the Finnish Base Profiles specification](https://hl7.fi/fhir/finnish-base-profiles/extensions.html).

In addition to the extensions published by HL7 Finland, there are also other extensions used in
Finland. Most notably the ones for the national Kanta system, in several implementation guides:

* [Kanta yhteiset FHIR- ja REST-rajapintamäärittelyt](https://simplifier.net/kanta-yhteiset-fhir)
  includes definitions shared by several other Kanta implementation guides.
* [Kanta Potilastiedon arkiston FHIR R4](https://simplifier.net/kanta-potilastiedon-arkiston-fhir-r4)
  included specifications for patient data stored in Kanta.
* [Kanta FHIR Prescription R4](https://simplifier.net/PrescriptionR4) includes specifications for
  data on prescriptions
* [Kanta sosiaalihuolto R4](https://simplifier.net/Kanta-sosiaalihuolto-R4) includes specifications
  for data related to welfare and social affairs.
* [Finnish PHR R4](https://simplifier.net/FinnishPHRR4) includes specifications for health and
  wellbeing data curated by the citizens in the Finnish national Personal Health Record platform
  Kanta PHR.
* [Kanta tietojen kansalaiskäytön rajapinnat](https://simplifier.net/kanta-tietojen-kansalaiskayton-rajapinnat)  
  includes specifications for citizen-centric apps accessing data in Kanta.

### Other Extensions

In addition to above, a
[registry of standard extensions](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extensibility-registry.html) can
be found in the FHIR specification and additional extensions may be registered on the HL7 FHIR
registry at [http://hl7.org/fhir/registry](http://hl7.org/fhir/registry).
